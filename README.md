# parkR: Functions I find helpful in R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The parkR package contains functions which I find useful as Iâ€™m working
in R, especially when making reports in R Markdown. Included are some
functions for quickly setting up HTML notebooks with R Markdown and
Bookdown, and some helpful functions for applying Markdown, LaTeX
commands, or HTML tags to text data in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of parkR using the `devtools`
package:

``` r
devtools::install_github(repo = "simpar1471/parkR")
```

## Feedback

Feedback is greatly appreciated, and should be done on the [GitHub
issues page](https://www.github.com/parkR/issues). Please be kind.
